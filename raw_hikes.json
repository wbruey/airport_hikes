From the parking lot on the Baltimore County (south) side of the Little Gunpowder, enter the trail.  Trail head is right in the middle of the lot.  Follow the trail along the Little Gunpowder.  There are four stream crossings and some nice rock gardens along the trail to Bottom road.  When the trail exits onto Bottom Road, go right across the bridge over the Little Gunpowder River.  Continue on Bottom Road until you pass Laurel Brook Road on your right.  Just past Laurel Brook Road, enter the trail again on the left.  The entry is a nice steep uphill climb to a flat trail.  This section of the trail is an old railroad bed, so it's pretty flat for about .75 miles.  At several points you can see the Little Gunpowder on your left down in the valley.  Continue on the old rail trail until it abruptly ends, then turn left.  There is a nice little 2 ft. drop around the first turn.  The trail continues towards Pleasantville Road, with a couple of nice uphill sections and some rooty, technical downhill sections. Once you've reached Pleasantville Road, take a left on Pleasantville and ride across the bridge over the Little Gunpowder.  Be careful here!  The cars headed northbound on Pleasantville have a sharp, almost blind turn to get onto the bridge.  Just over the bridge, lift your bike over the guard rail and onto the trail again.  You're now in the Balto county again.  The first section of trail has a nice, technical downhill section to a small stream crossing.  The trail on this side of the L'il Gunpowder has some swooping up and downhill sections with stream crossings at the terminus of each downhill. Some fun technical sections, too.  Continue along this trail until it dumps you out onto Bottom Road again.  Come out of the woods and go left on Bottom, back down towards the L'il Gunpowder.  Enter the woods on the right before you cross the bridge and backtrack along the little Gunpowder towards Hardord Road.  At two of the stream crossings on this leg there are side loops that follow the streams uphill, cross the stream, the follow it back downhill.  One of them has a nice, small waterfall at the top.  This is a multi-use trail, and during the summer sections of it can be overgrown.  Sticker bushes, the unofficial MD state flower.

Beginner to intermediate.  Would rate much higher overall if the trails were longer.  Very pretty township park in nice country/suburban town.  Be prepared for wildlife encounters: deer are *everywhere* in this park.  You'll also get close to rabbits, groundhogs, skunks, foxes, oppossums, squirrels (seen them all), dozens of varieties of birds, turtles near the pond, and muskrats near the stream.  Also, as much of this track is wooded, be prepared for the occasional downed tree, fallen branches, things buried under leaves, etc.  Very low likelihood of getting lost.<br /><br />Figure 8 with a 1\u00c2\u00bd-mile loop in the &quot;main park&quot; and a 1\u00c2\u00bd-mile loop &quot;across the road,&quot; but there are a number of connecting paths and side trails.  You can ride these trails several times, connecting and reconnecting from various points, before everything starts to look the same.  Expect casual hikers and dog walkers on both sides of the road, many more on the main park side, but the main park also leaves much more room to work around them.  Also expect sports traffic near the athletic fields some afternoons and weekends.  The main park is strictly beginner level, but is still worth the ride for more seasoned riders, as the views are beautiful.  Across the road is mostly single track with several intermediate quality stretches of techy terrain.  <br /><br />Both parking lots are on the main side of the park, so we'll start there.  From the parking lot on Pleasant Grove Road, face uphill towards the tennis courts (roughly northwest).  You can take off in either direction from here.  If you start to the left you will make a clockwise loop.  Look for the unpaved maintenance road heading into the woods.  After opening up into a field, look for another entrance to the woods on your left.  Quick, open, double track downhill with a few rocks, roots and plenty of loose impediments leads down to the pond.  Loop around the pond if you want.  Cut back into the woods on the far right side of the pond.  Follow the double track through the woods up to the parking lot access road.  Cut across the access road and continue on the crushed gravel path past the athletic fields back to where you started, or bear left down the hill toward South Concord Road and cross over to the second loop.<br /><br />This is definitely a trail you want to ride in both directions as each offers a unique experience.  Also, if you ride here in mid-summer, wild raspberries everywhere.  Stop for a few minutes and enjoy a great snack.  This side of the track is much more challenging than the main park side.  Beginners *will* get bounced around, and I've seen a few endos here including one or two of my own.<br />Clockwise:  Cross the road and head left.  Turn right down the broken driveway keeping the cornfield on your right.  Look for an opening into the woods on the left before you reach the old farmhouse at the bottom of the hill.  Gradual climb through the woods with a few ups and downs and a few roots to keep things interesting.  Very quick downhill with switchback hairpins at the bottom brings you to the creek bottom.  Follow the single track along the creek, cross the wooden footbridge, and start the climb out of the creek bottom.  Rocks, roots, ruts and some loose terrain for a few hundred yards of moderately steep climbing.  A few hundred yards of rollers and easy climbing before emerging on the back side of the cornfield.  Keep the corn on your right until you get back to the single track in the woods.  You'll emerge at South Concord Road near where you crossed out of the main park.  Cross back and ride another loop in the main park, or turn around and reverse this loop immediately.<br />Counterclockwise:  This time keeping the corn on your left enter the woods on your right onto the single track.  After crossing the back side of the cornfield, back into the woods for a nice rolling downhill, followed by a steep descent to the creek bottom with all the aforementioned rocks &amp; roots.  Mud &amp; loose sand at the bottom.  Follow the single track along the creek and climb the steep hill out of the creek bottom.  It's not long (only 250-300 yards) but its's steep (over 20%) and covered with slick glass.  Fun fast rollers back to the broken driveway.

Miles 18-22 in particular are well suited for novices as it hugs the shoreline which makes it virtually flat. This is not to say the trail is without its challenges. The length alone can be taxing to most cyclists and there are many climbs which are short in duration but steep in slope.

The trail is multi-user and is frequented by hikers, birdwatchers and equestrians as well as bicyclists.

The water from the splash pool at the base of the falls, continuing as the Eight Mile River, flows through the park&amp;#39;s hemlock-canopied picnic area, providing a tranquil setting for a family outing. Many myths surround the name of the park, including one about a man named Dibble, who grew hops for beer-brewing. Through usage, Dibble&amp;#39;s Hopyard supposedly became Devil&amp;#39;s Hopyard. Another tale says that the Devil passed by the falls and accidentally wet his tail. Furious, he burned holes in the stones with his hooves as he bounded away.

This ride is a grueling 4 hours (at least) and is not for beginners.  How I like to connect all three parks:&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />Park on the Sussex branch trailhead at Allamuchy State Park North.  Bike up the sussex branch trail about 4 or 5 miles until you reach the green trail (waving willie) on the left.  From waving willie, make a right onto the white trail and continue on the white trail until you reach the purple trail (cardiac/ditch) on your left.  Turn onto this trail and ride it out until you get to the orange trail, which you merge onto and this finally takes you out of Allamuchy onto county route 517.  Make a left onto county route 517 and climb up the road and over highway route 80 until you see the Mountain Villa School on the left.  Turn into the school and you will bike through the parking lot and down a grass field until the see the Allamuchy lake trail.   To make sure you are going the correct direction, keep the lake to your right.  This makes its way into Allamuchy Deer Park.  Make the first left onto a trail and continue until you see the white trail in Deer Park, which you merge onto (there will be a slight right that you DO NOT want to take).  Continue on the white trail until you see the orange trail on the left, which you will take until it drops you out onto Waterloo Road.  Make a right onto Waterloo Road and then an immediate left onto Kinney Road.  On Kinney Road, you will cross a bridge and then see an iron gate on the left.  Take the trail around the iron gate and you will be in an abandoned parking lot.  There will be a trail to the left of that parking lot that takes you through a quarry and eventually to waterloo valley road.  There will be a trail directly across waterloo valley road.  Take this trail until it ends and make a left.  The trail that you turn left onto is more of a rail trail than singletrack.  This trail will then turn right underneath a railroad and there will be multiple options of singletrack trail that you can take after that.  From there, it gets too confusing to describe the route.  However, if you successfully loop around and back to the trail that goes underneath the railroad, take it again and make a right onto a trail that leads you back to waterloo valley road.  From here, slightly to the right there is a trail that goes downhill and is mostly pavement.  This trail goes underneath route 80 and takes you back to continental drive.  Take a left onto continental drive, and you will be back to the Allamuchy State Park north parking lot! This route is very difficult to explain in words, so I would recommend using a garmin gps route and using your smart phone to do the ride.

Approximately 1.3 miles into the ride there will be a large orange puddle on the road. This puddle is very deep and is easiest to cross on the left side. Continue on the old mining road until approximately 1.85 miles into the ride. The mining road will get sandy and a trail that goes through a motorcycle racetrack will be on the right. Take the trail on the right that goes through the motorcycle track. At 2.0 miles into the ride you will see an Orange/Rust colored abandoned earthmover, locally known as &quot;The Walking Duck&quot;, on the left side. Follow the hill on the right of the Walking Duck to the top. At the top of this hill there will be a short downhill that leads to a short uphill, the right side is a little easier. At the top of the short uphill there will be a culmbank in the distance in front of you, a road that goes down the mountain on your extreme left, a road that bears to the left but goes to the culmbank, and an area on your right that heads up the mountain. Take the road that bears to the left and leads you to the culm banks. Follow this road up a hill and make a left at the top. Approximately 20 yards on the right side of the road there will be a single-track trail heading into the woods. Take this trail. This trail has a hill on it that is approximately 4 feet tall. After this hill you will want to bear right and head up the road with large flat rocks on it. At the top of this trail you will come to another large shale area with trees in front of you, a view of a large grassy field in the distance to your left, a sharp right road, and a road that bears right. Follow the road that bears right to a Y in the road, approximately 2.36 miles into the ride. At the Y the road, a sharp left fork leads down the mountain, don't take this road. The road on the right (may seem like the one in the middle) of the Y is what you want to take. Follow this road until you have power lines above you, a cliff to your left, and a trail that follows the power lines up the mountain on the right. Follow the trail up the power lines for two towers. Immediately after the second tower you will see a trail on your left. Follow this trail until it comes to another road. Make a right to take this rocky road up the mountain until you come to a four-way intersection. At this intersection there will be an orange and black metal box on your left approximately 3.58 miles into the ride. Take the right and continue up the mountain until you come to a red ash Y in the road. Take the trail to the right, which will take you over two small roadblocks. This road will lead you to a field. At the field there will be a sharp right and a road that bears to the right. Take the road that bears to the right and follow it through the field eventually coming to a short downhill. At the bottom of this downhill you will want to take the sharp right and head back up the mountain. Following this trail will take you into a canyon looking area with ash hills on both sides. Keep following this twisty rock filled trail up a hill. At the top of this hill, 4.5 miles into the ride, you will have the ash canyon behind you, a sharp right that goes up the mountain, and the trail continuing in front of you. Continue on the trail in front of you down a hill. At the bottom of the hill make a right and follow that trail up the mountain over a roadblock to a T in the road. Take the right up the hill until you come to a Y in the Road. The left portion of the Y will have a roadblock on it. The trail on the right is a hill about ten feet long. Take the trail to the right. At the top of the 10-foot hill you can see the community of Glen Lyon. Follow the trail up a hill to the top of this hill, where you will be approximately 5.0 miles into the ride. The trail will turn rocky and head downhill. Follow this trail for another tenth of a mile until you see a trail that heads into the woods on your right. Take the trail on your right into the woods and up the mountain. Approximately 5.37 miles into the ride you will pass off a Y in the road (keep going straight) and come to a T in the road. The T in the road has a patch of trees in the middle of it. Follow the trail to the right into the woods until you come to another Y in the road. Take the trail on the right up a rocky hill and continue on the trail. This trail will bring you to another Y in the road. Take the left. AT 5.75 miles into the ride you will be on top of the mountain with a scenic overlook of route 11, the Susquehanna River, and S.C.I Retreat on your left and a swamp on your right. Continue on the trail around the swamp until you come to a Y in the road. Take the left. Follow this single track through the woods until you come to a T in the road. Follow the mining road to the left up the hill until a path appears between the trees on your left. Follow the path down a hill past the small brick building and the old radio towers. Follow this trail until it takes a sharp right and a faint trail is on your left. Take the faint trail into the woods over the fallen trees using the tire ruts as a guide to a well-defined single-track path. Follow this path up a hill to the right through some pine trees. Try to stay to the base of the ridge through the pine trees. After making it through the pine trees you will come to a T in the road. Both the right and left go downhill to different sides of the mountain and the road straight in front of you goes up the mountain. Take the trail in front of you up the mountain. This trail is a long rocky steep uphill climb. You will come to a Y in the road. The right heads down the mountain and the left heads up the mountain. Take the left up the mountain. After some more strenuous uphill climbs you will come to another Y in the road, approximately 7.91 miles into the ride. The left heads over the mountain while the right heads up the mountain. Follow the right up the mountain until you are about 8.0 miles into the ride. Here you will be at another Y in the road. The left will take you to the top of the Power lines where you can overlook the UGI power plant, Route 11, and the Susquehanna River. The right will go uphill then downhill. At the bottom of this hill, do not follow it completely down the power lines; take the left into the woods. This trail will go down a hill with a puddle at the bottom. Continue to follow the trail down a rocky boulder field like trail, which will be tricky. This trail will have a puddle at the bottom and a path that goes to the right. Take the path to the right past the first Y in the road to the second Y in the road. The trail on the right goes down the mountain. The trail on the left goes up the mountain. Take the trail on the left. After a short distance up the mountain you will have an old mining hole on your left known locally as &quot;Bear ass beach&quot;. Continue on the trail up the mountain. At 9.0 miles into the ride there will be a mud pit. Continue past the mud pit up the mountain to another Y in the road. The right will go down the mountain and the left take you to the top. Follow the trail to your left. You will pass another overlook of Route 11, the Susquehanna River, and the Garden Drive-in. The trail will turn into single track and go into the woods. Continue on the trail into the woods until you come to a T in the road. Take the left. Follow this trail to another T in the road. Take the right. You will go past an Alltel cellular tower to a Y in the road. Take the left. This trail is a fast downhill that will lead you to another yellow gate.

I asked a park ranger if there was any good singletrack, and HE SHOWED ME THE EQUINE TRAILS!  He told me that the rangers typically don't enforce the bike restriction unless they have a horse event or they get complaints about bikes running afoul of the horses.  Rule of thumb, if you see a number of horse trailers at the Walnut Hill parking lot, stay off the marked portion of the singletrack.  Otherwise, ride at your own risk (or ask a ranger first like I did).<br /><br />2)  This trail runs parallel to, and easily connects to, the Schuykill River Trail and the Perkiomen Valley Trail.
