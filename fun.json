          "description": "I have been riding serious for over 10 years. I am 28 years old, my career as a personal trainer pushes me further to appreciate mountain biking. I have been to a decent amount of trails, including MOAB out west, and the famous Crested Butte, Colorado. I live very local to the Skylands Manor. I love it here in New Jersey. I know some other good riding not far, in New York. Ringwood by far is the hottest, roughest trail. If you like difficult climbs, tricky obstacles, including riding across fallen trees, 5 feet in the air, 25 feet long, this is the place for you.<br />I ride a hard tail bike, front suspension of course. ANY bike shop in New Jersey is familiar with Ringwood riding. There are many for than 10 miles of trails here, but the 10-mile singletrack loop is plenty enough. After about 8 mikes, your legs are pretty shot.<br />",

Trail 3 also cuts out some mileage but is a tight rocky trail. Trail 6 is a option to skip out of some switchbacks but beware it is rocky. Trail 8a,8b,and 8c are out expert trails with lots of rocks and steep descents. All of our trails are intermediate/expert,non directional,multi-use trails.So be alert and polite to others.For a quick beverage or a bit to eat, be sure to stop in to Trails End cafe or the Grille.Located in our hotel.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />",

While there is a dirt road that can take you to it (from near the Hickory Run SP office), you can also hike there.  The trail is about 3 miles each way: it's an out-n-back.  Maybe not the most spectacular hike around, but still a nice walk in the woods, and a great payoff at Boulder Field.  Plus you come out to the BF on the other side from where most tourists drive to it, so you get a totally different perspective on it.  After hanging out there for a while and enjoying the amazing boulders, the hike back might be a bit anti-climactic, but at least it's flat and even a little downhill... &lt;br /&gt;<br />There's a JTX guide service that does a 'best of Hickory Run' tour which includes several hikes in the park, and a visit to Boulder Field by either hike or car (depends on what other hikes are included).  If you don't know the area, this might be a good option.",

Lake Aeroflex and Gardnerâs Pond form part of the headwaters of the Pequest River and are excellent for fishing and boating. This scenic property is home to a variety of wildlife such as whitetail deer, wild turkey, a variety of songbirds, beaver, muskrats, and squirrels.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />Hunting, hiking, mountain biking, birding, and horseback riding are popular activities. The four lakes offer fishing, boating, and kayaking opportunities.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />The Paulinskill Valley Trail and the Sussex Branch Trail are former railroads that have been converted for use as multiple use trails. Both railroads were critical to the development of Sussex County through the late 1800âs and early 1900âs. The wide cinder surface is ideal for walking, running, mountain biking, and horseback riding. When snow conditions are abundant, these trails provide and excellent opportunity for cross-country skiing, and snowshoeing. You might even see a musher and his dogsled team running down the trail!",

It protects both the underground resources of the Old Bridge Sands aquifer, and a unique pine barrens habitat in Middlesex County. Jamesburg Park Conservation Area lies within the Spotswood Outlier-the northernmost area of New Jersey Pine Barrens habitat.  Along the several miles of trails you can find typical Pine Barrens species-pitch pine trees, blueberries, huckleberries and post oaks.  The wetlands protect  Atlantic white cedar trees and carnivorous pitcher plants.  Several endangered and threatened species of plants and animals have been observed in this preserved open space.  Parking, portable restrooms, picnic tables and a playground can be found at Helme Mill Park on Maple Street in Helmetta.",
